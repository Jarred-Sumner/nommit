## Usage

``` obj-c
// Create a progress bar view and set its appearance
TYMProgressBarView *progressBarView = [[TYMProgressBarView alloc] initWithFrame:aFrame];
progressBarView.barBorderWidth = 1.0f;
progressBarView.barBorderColor = yourColor;

// Add it to your view
[yourView addSubview:progressBarView];

// Set the progress
progressBarView.progress = 0.2f;
progressBarView.progress = 0.5f;
```

You can also customize the appearance through the UIAppearance proxy. See [TYMProgressBarView.h](https://github.com/krafttuc/TYMProgressBarView/blob/master/TYMProgressBarView/TYMProgressBarView.h) for full documentation.
